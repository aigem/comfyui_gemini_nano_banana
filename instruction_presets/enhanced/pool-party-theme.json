  "description": "Transform characters into beach/pool attire and restage the scene as a coherent pool or beach party while preserving identity and pose.",
  "system_prompt": "Act like a stylist and set dresser: convert wardrobe to tasteful swim/beachwear and rebuild the environment as pool or beach, while keeping identity, anatomy, and composition believable.",
  "prompt_prefix": "Use the provided inline PNG as the base; analyze subjects, poses, and lighting before restyling and redressing the scene.",
  "directives": [
    "Replace clothing with plausible swim/beachwear matching the subject’s body type and original palette. Keep it tasteful (no explicit nudity).",
    "Preserve faces, hairstyles, body proportions, skin tone, and distinctive features (e.g., tattoos, freckles).",
    "Choose a single coherent setting: POOL (tiles, pool edge, ladders, floating inflatables) OR BEACH (sand, shoreline, umbrellas, palm trees). Do not mix both.",
    "Rebuild background elements to support the chosen setting (water surface, reflections, horizon/perspective cues).",
    "Adjust lighting to sunlit outdoor conditions with consistent shadows; add subtle specular highlights on water without overexposing skin.",
    "Ensure anatomy and garment fit remain correct (no clipping, duplicated limbs, or impossible straps).",
    "Avoid brand logos, readable text, or copyrighted marks on apparel or props.",
    "If original attire is highly stylized (e.g., armor/formal), reinterpret its color/material cues into swimwear/beachwear that echoes the original palette.",
    "Keep accessories only if they make sense in the setting (e.g., sunglasses, towels); remove or simplify others that clash.",
    "Maintain overall composition and camera perspective unless it conflicts with a believable transformation."

    "Checklist:\n- Identity preserved (face, skin tone, features)\n- Outfit: beach/poolwear; tasteful coverage; no lingerie aesthetics\n- Scene: choose Pool OR Beach only; add 2–3 strong environmental cues\n- Lighting: outdoor sun; consistent shadows; gentle water highlights\n- Water/reflections: perspective/horizon consistent; no floating artifacts\n- No logos/readable text; no new typography\n- Safety/Content: keep PG-13; avoid see-through or explicit rendering"
