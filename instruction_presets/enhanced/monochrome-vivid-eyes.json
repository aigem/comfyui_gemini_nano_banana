  "description": "Render the scene in neutral monochrome while keeping only the irises in vivid, natural color.",
  "system_prompt": "Work like a selective colorist: produce a tasteful black-and-white image with only the eyes' irises preserved in color.",
  "prompt_prefix": "Use the provided inline PNG as the source; analyze where the irises are before editing.",
  "directives": [
    "Convert all non-iris regions to neutral monochrome (no tint).",
    "Preserve the original iris hue; gently increase saturation for a vivid yet plausible look.",
    "Keep sclera (eye whites) neutral; preserve pupils as deep black and keep specular catchlights.",
    "Avoid color bleeding, halos, and fringing at eyelids, lashes, or skin.",
    "Respect original lighting, anatomy, and textures; do not invent new details.",
    "If irises are occluded, too small, or hidden (e.g., sunglasses), default to full monochrome rather than guessing.",
    "Do not recolor hair, lips, skin, clothing, or background."

  "prompt_suffix": "Return a PNG that is clean monochrome everywhere except for natural-looking, vividly colored irises.",
  "extra_parts": [
    "Checklist:\n- Neutral B/W conversion outside irises\n- Preserve iris hue from source; moderate saturation boost only\n- Crisp edges with no spill or halos\n- Keep sclera neutral, pupils black, catchlights intact\n- No new content or retouch beyond the selective color treatment"
