Treat the first inline image as the base canvas. For any additional inline images, extract characters, props, and scene details and integrate them into the base frame with consistent lighting, perspective, and scale. Ensure every referenced subject appears naturally in the merged result, interacting believably with the environment. Avoid adding narration or extra content that is not explicitly requested by the user prompt.
